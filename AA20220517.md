- Definition 7: **Relation**
  
    Assuming $A$ is a non-empty set, $R$ is a subset of $A \times A$, $a, b \in A$, if $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ and $b$ have relationship $R$, written as $aRb$, and $R$ is a relation of $A$ (Binary relation).

<br>

- Definition 8: If a relation $R$ from set $A$ satisfies the following: 

    1. Reflexive Relation: $aRa, \hspace{5pt} \forall a \in A;$

    2. Symmetric Relation: $aRb \Longrightarrow bRa, \hspace{5pt} \forall a, b \in A;$

    3. Transitive Relation: $aRb, bRc \Longrightarrow aRc, \hspace{5pt} \forall a,b,c \in A.$

    We define that the relation $R$ is an **Equivalence relation** of $A$.

<br>

- Definition 9: **Partition & Class**
  
    $A$ has some non-empty subsets, each subset is called a **class** of $A$, and if every element of $A$ belong and only belong to one class, we defined a **partition** as all the classes of set $A$. 

<br>

$\hspace{15pt}$**Theorem 1. A class of set $A$ determines an equivalence relation of $A$.**

$\hspace{15pt}$**Theorem 2. An equivalence relation of set $A$ determines a class of $A$.**

<br>

- Definition 10: **Equivalence Class**
  
    Assuming set $A$ has an equivalence relation $R$, $a \in A,$ define **Equivalence Class** as the set of all elements in set $A$ that's equivalent to $a$: \{$b\in A \hspace{2pt} | \hspace{2pt} bRa$\}, written as $\bar{a}$.

<br>

- Definition 11: **Quotient Set**

    Assuming we have an equivalence relation $R$ in $A$, and a set of all equivalence class \{$\bar{a}$\}, with the relation $R$, is called the quotient set of $A$ by $R$, written as $A/R$.

<br>

- Definition 12: **Cononical Map**

    Assuming we have an equivalence relation $R$ in set $A$, the mapping $\pi: A \rightarrow A/R,$ $\pi(a) = \bar{a}, \hspace{5pt} \forall a \in A$ is defined as the **Cononical Map** from $A$ to $A/R$.

    - Cononical Map is Surjective, but not necessarily Injective.
