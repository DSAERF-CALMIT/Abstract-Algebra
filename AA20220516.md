## Sets and operations

Sets have no strict definition (paradox: Barbar paradox)

<br>

- Definition 1: Assume $A_0$ is a <u>non-empty</u> subset of $A$, we call  $\iota$ the **inclusive map** if the mapping from $A_0$ to $A$ is as following:

    $\iota: A_0 \rightarrow A, \hspace{5pt} \iota(x) = x$

<br>

- Definition 2: Assume $A$, $B$ are two sets, define:

    $A \times B =$ <span style="font-size: 20px;">{</span>$(a, b) \hspace{1pt} | \hspace{1pt} a \in A, b \in B$<span style="font-size: 20px;">}</span>

    as the **direct product / Cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$. 

    - Similarly, we can define: 

        $A_1 \times ... \times A_k =$ <span style="font-size: 20px;">{</span>$(a_1, ... , a_k) \hspace{1pt} | \hspace{1pt} a_i \in A, i = 1, ... ,k$<span style="font-size: 20px;">}</span>

        as the direct product of a <u>limited amount (k)</u> of sets.

<br>

- Definition 3: Assume $A$, $B$, $D$ are all non-empty sets, then any mapping $f$ from $A \times B$ to $D$ is called an **algebraic operation** from $A$ and $B$ to $D$. 

    - This is to say that if $a \in A, b \in B$, then $(a, b) \in A \times B$, $f( \hspace{2pt} (a, b) \hspace{2pt} ) = d \in D$. In other words, $a$ and $b$ determine $d$.

    - Another notation for $f( \hspace{2pt} (a, b) \hspace{2pt} )$ is $a \circ b.$ We have the previous operation written as $a \circ b = d$.

    - By changing $\circ$ to other operation notations, we then have something like $1+2=3$ and $1 \times 2 = 2$

    - $A=B=D$ is mostly used in the algebraic operation: the algebraic operation from $A$ and $A$ to $A$, also called the **Binary operation** in $A$.

<br>

- Definition 4: **Associative property:**

    $(a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c), \hspace{5pt} \forall a, b, c \in A.$

<br>

- Definition 5: **Commutative property**

    $a \circ b = b \circ a, \hspace{5pt} \forall a, b \in A.$

<br>

- Definition 6: **Distributive property**

    $a \circ (b + c) = a \circ b + a \circ c, \hspace{5pt} a, b, c \in A.$

    - Operation $\circ$ is distributive over $+$ (if it is left and right distributive).

    - Left distributive: $a \circ (b + c) = a \circ b + a \circ c.$

    - Right distributive: $(b + c) \circ a = b \circ a + c \circ a.$

    - It is easier to think of $\circ$ as $\times$ here.
