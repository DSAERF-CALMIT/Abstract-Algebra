### About the course


- #### Abstract

    As a matter of fact, algebra is abstract, especially when digging into areas such as the algebraic structure, which is one of the most important concentrations in abstract algebra.

- #### What is Algebraic Structure

    - Groups

    - Rings

    - Vector Space $\rightleftharpoons$ Fields

    - Lattice

    - Et cetera

- #### Applications
